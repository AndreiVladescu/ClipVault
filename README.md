# ClipVault

A cross-platform clipboard history for text & images, built with **Rust** + **egui/eframe**.  
ClipVault lives in your **system tray**, supports a global hotkey (CTRL+SHIFT+V) to toggle the window, and **encrypts your history at rest** using an Argon2-derived key and **XChaCha20-Poly1305**.
